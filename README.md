The files

1) at_seed_serial (anytime with Sub-Weibull noise)
2) ft_seed_serial (finite horizon with Sub-Weibull noise)
3) ft_seed_serial_poly (finite horizon with polynomially-tailed noise)

perform the experiments described in the paper.

The files oracle_seed and SSgMavg_class implement the stochastic first-order oracle and the algorithms respectively.

To run an experiment, download the folder and run of the files 1),2), or 3).
